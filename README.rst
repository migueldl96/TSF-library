TSF library
===========

TSF is a library that extend Scikit-learn_ software composed by several time series preprocessing algorithms developed
at the University of Cordoba in the `Learning and Artificial Neural Networks (AYRNA)`_ research group.
This library is able to preprocess any time serie, either univariate or multivariate,
and create a inputs matrix for every sample of the time serie(s) so any model of Scikit-learn_ can be trained.
